ECE 2300 Labs Repository
==========================================================================

This is the code repository for your group ECE 2300 lab assignment. You
will use this repository to develop your code, run continuous integration
tests, and submit the remaining labs with your partner(s).

### GitHub Actions Continuous Integration

We will be using GitHub Actions as our continuous integration service.
Continuous integration means all of the tests for your repository will
be run automatically every time you push to this repository. The
current status of these tests is shown with the badges below. If a
badge says "failing" in red then your repository is currently failing
one or more tests; if a badge says "passed" in green then your
repository is passing all tests. You can click on the badge to find
out more about which tests are passing or failing. If the badge is a
broken link, then the corresponding lab part has not been released
yet.

### GitHub and Academic Integrity Violations

Students are explicitly prohibited from sharing their code with anyone
that is not on the course staff. This includes making public forks or
duplicating this repository on a different repository hosting service.
Students are also explicitly prohibited from manipulating the Git history
or changing any of the tags that are created by the course staff. The
course staff maintain a copy of all repositories, so we will easily
discover if a student manipulates a repository in some inappropriate way.
Normal users will never have an issue, but advanced users have been
warned.

Sharing code, manipulating the Git history, or changing staff tags will
be considered a violation of the Code of Academic Integrity. A primary
hearing will be held, and if found guilty, students will face a serious
penalty on their grade for this course. More information about the Code
of Academic Integrity can be found here:
